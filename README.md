# Payment Hub

Central payment service. **Only this service talks to Paystack.** Your 10 websites talk to this hub's own API instead — they never see your Paystack secret key, and Paystack never talks to them directly.

## 1. Deploy on Railway

1. Push this repo to GitHub, connect it in Railway.
2. Add a **Volume** to this service (Railway dashboard → your service → Settings → Volumes), and set its mount path to `/data`. No Postgres plugin needed — the database is a single SQLite file that lives on this volume, so it survives restarts/redeploys.
3. Set these environment variables in Railway:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — `file:/data/hub.db` (must match the volume's mount path from step 2 — note the required `file:` prefix; `/data/hub.db` alone will fail)
   - `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` (from your Paystack dashboard, live or test)
   - `PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `ADMIN_API_KEY` — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`, keep it private to you
   - `TRANSACTIONS_ADMIN_PATH` — optional. Defaults to `secret` (i.e. `/secret`). Set this if you want the successful-transactions portal at a different path.
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — comma-separated list of your 10 site domains (only needed if calling from browser JS)
   - `HUB_PUBLIC_URL` — the Railway-assigned public URL of this service
4. Railway runs `scripts/entrypoint.sh` automatically (see `railway.json`), which syncs the schema with `prisma db push` and creates `hub.db` on the volume the first time it deploys.
5. In the Paystack Dashboard → Settings → API Keys & Webhooks, set the webhook URL to:
   ```
   https://<your-hub>.up.railway.app/webhook/paystack
   ```

### A note on SQLite + volumes

This trades Postgres for a zero-cost SQLite file on a Railway Volume, which is plenty for a hub fronting 10 sites. Two things to know:
- **Single instance only.** A Railway Volume attaches to one running instance, so don't scale this service to multiple replicas — SQLite isn't built for concurrent writers across instances anyway.
- **Back it up.** There's no automatic point-in-time recovery like a managed Postgres plugin gives you. Periodically download `hub.db` (e.g. via a Railway shell / `railway run`) if you want restore points.

Startup runs through `scripts/entrypoint.sh` rather than calling Prisma directly. It checks `DATABASE_URL` is set and auto-prepends `file:` if you forget it in Railway's Variables tab, then runs `prisma db push` to sync the schema — no separate `prisma/migrations` folder to keep in sync or get stuck on a failed step.

## 2. Register your 10 websites

### Option A — Admin dashboard (easiest)

Visit `https://<your-hub>.up.railway.app/1234567890`, enter your `ADMIN_API_KEY`, and use the form to connect each site. The API key + secret are shown once in a popup — copy them into that site's environment immediately.

### Successful transactions portal (separate from the dashboard above)

A second, separate admin page lists **only successful transactions** — reference, paying customer's email, amount, and which of your sites it belongs to — and lets you permanently delete an individual successful transaction record.

It lives at a different path than the merchant dashboard above:

```
https://<your-hub>.up.railway.app/secret
```

(override the path via `TRANSACTIONS_ADMIN_PATH` if you'd rather use something else)

It's gated by the same `ADMIN_API_KEY` as everything else. It calls two endpoints:

- `GET /admin/transactions/successful` — list all `SUCCESS` transactions.
- `DELETE /admin/transactions/:id` — delete one transaction, **only** if its status is `SUCCESS` (any other status is rejected with `409`).

### Option B — CLI script

Run this once per site (locally or via Railway's shell):

```bash
HUB_URL=https://<your-hub>.up.railway.app \
ADMIN_API_KEY=<your admin key> \
node src/scripts/createMerchant.js "site1.com" "https://site1.com/webhooks/hub"
```

This returns an `apiKey` and `apiSecret` **shown only once** — store them in that site's own environment variables (`.env`), never commit them.

## 3. How each of your 10 sites calls the hub

### Start a payment

```
POST https://<your-hub>/api/v1/transaction/initialize
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  x-api-key: <that site's apiKey>
  x-signature: HMAC-SHA512( JSON body, that site's apiSecret )  — hex encoded
Body:
  {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "GHS",
    "redirectUrl": "https://site1.com/order/123/thank-you",
    "metadata": { "orderId": "123" }
  }
```

`redirectUrl` is **required** — it's the page on *your own site* the customer should land on after paying. Paystack only ever redirects the browser to the hub's own `/return/:reference` URL; the hub then verifies the payment and forwards the browser on to this `redirectUrl` with `?reference=...&status=...` appended. This is how the hub knows which of your 10 sites to send the customer back to, since Paystack itself never sees your site URLs.

`metadata` is optional and can be any JSON your own site wants attached to this transaction (order id, user id, etc.). It's stored on the hub's own `Transaction` row and echoed back to you unchanged — via `GET /verify/:reference` and the webhook the hub sends your `webhookUrl` — but it is **never forwarded to Paystack**. Paystack only ever receives `email`, `amount`, the hub's own generated `reference`, and the hub's own `callback_url`; nothing that identifies which merchant site a transaction belongs to, and none of your business data, is ever sent to Paystack.

Response gives `checkoutUrl` — redirect the customer there. It's a hub URL that shows a brief visible "taking you to Paystack" page (the same kind of interstitial used on the way back, at `/return/:reference`) before continuing on to Paystack's checkout page, so the customer always sees where they're headed instead of an invisible instant redirect. The raw `authorizationUrl` from Paystack is also included, in case you'd rather skip that interstitial and send the customer straight to Paystack yourself.

Node.js example for a merchant site to call this:

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const axios = require('axios');

const body = { email: 'customer@example.com', amount: 5000 };
const raw = JSON.stringify(body);
const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha512', process.env.HUB_API_SECRET).update(raw).digest('hex');

const { data } = await axios.post('https://<your-hub>/api/v1/transaction/initialize', body, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': process.env.HUB_API_KEY,
    'x-signature': signature,
  },
});

// redirect customer to data.data.checkoutUrl (shows a visible "going to Paystack" page first)
// or straight to data.data.authorizationUrl if you don't want that interstitial
```

### Verify a payment

```
GET https://<your-hub>/api/v1/transaction/verify/:reference
Headers: x-api-key, x-signature (signature over an empty body "")
```

### Receive completion webhook

The hub POSTs to the `webhookUrl` you registered for that site, with header `x-hub-signature`. Verify it the same way the hub verifies Paystack:

```js
const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha512', HUB_API_SECRET).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
if (expected !== req.headers['x-hub-signature']) reject();
```

## 4. Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values, DATABASE_URL can point at a local file e.g. file:./dev.db
npm install
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

## Security notes

- Paystack secret key exists **only** in this service's environment.
- Each of your 10 sites gets its own `apiKey`/`apiSecret` pair — revoke one via `PATCH /admin/merchants/:id/toggle` without affecting the others.
- All merchant→hub and hub→merchant traffic is HMAC-signed, not just API-key gated.
- Webhook signature from Paystack is verified before any DB write.
